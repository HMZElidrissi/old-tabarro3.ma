## tabaro3

This is my fil rouge project at YouCode, and it aims to enhance blood donation in Morocco by connecting potential donors
with those in need. It addresses the challenges of awareness and ease of access in blood donation and the difficulty of
finding donors in emergencies.

## Technologies Used

- Laravel 10 (RESTful API)
- Next.js + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- PostgreSQL

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
